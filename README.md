# C/AT - An AT clone written in C!

C/AT is an emulater for the [IBM PC/AT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Personal_Computer/AT) and clones.
It also aims to be ["100% compatible"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_PC_compatible) by emulating various hardware devices (8088, 8253, etc.) as well as de facto hardware standards of the time (EGA, 8042, etc.).
It is based on the efforts of my earlier [PyXT project](https://github.com/astamp/PyXT).

### Why?
I currently don't know anything about how protected mode works on an x86 machine and this is how I plan to find out.

I've also never constructed a large C-only (not++) application so this should be fun.

### Status
Currently nothing works, but stay tuned for more...
